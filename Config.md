# How to configure the OSD #


You can configure some things with the 'OSD Config Tool'.

How to do so is explained here: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/OSD_Config_Tool

Use the 'OSD Config Tool' from my code section trunk/Tools, it's the same as of my other project minOPOSD.


Currently the following views are supported for the minEASYOSD:

Visible Sats
