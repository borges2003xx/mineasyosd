minEASYOSD runs on the cheap MinimOSD hardware and is an implementation of an OSD using a cheap GPS for FPV flights.

This project is GNU GPL v3 and using it is at your own risk.

You need no extra soldering at the MinimOSD, therefore the name minEASYOSD.

It's based on my other OSD project for NAZA, the minNAZAOSD: http://code.google.com/p/minnazaosd/

and on the ArduCamOSD code: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/
